The Revolutionary War MVP and celebrity endorser of\r\n   the one dollar bill knew that no amount of prestige or accomplishments could rival\r\n   the warm satisfaction of a good glass of whiskey.\r\n In days past, a man's fondness for whiskey was admirably brandished in full home bars, but in modern times,\r\n   whiskey is hidden out of sight in cabinets and desk drawers like shameful secrets. The Whiskey Appreciation\r\n   Crate is here to restore honor to the once great bond between a man and his drink.\r\n Oh, yes we de-can! Etching your initials into a glass decanter is a public declaration of your affinity for whiskey.\r\n   It's like donning a trenchcoat and holding a boombox overhead blasting Peter Gabriel's\r\n   \"In Your Eyes\" outside of whiskey's house or barging past the TSA checkpoint to frantically\r\n   sprint through the airport terminal for a last second  whiskey\r\n   before boarding your plane.\r\n While the monogrammed decanter looks super classy when flanked by its matching pair of personalized\r\n   rocks tumblers, whiskey should be appraised by taste as well as  presentation. The decanter properly\r\n   aerates and settles your whiskey so you can settle down with a glass of good company anytime.\r\n Good Company Rounding out the Whiskey Appreciation Crate is the ultimate whiskey connoisseur collection: A pair of\r\n   Tovolo Ice Molds and slate coasters, a pocket-sized whiskey tasting journal, and the most important whiskey\r\n   accessory, premium savory snacks.\r\n Box up those dusty sports trophies and find a stud to hang your awkward family portraits, because the\r\n   Personalized Whiskey Decanter is reclaiming whiskey's proper place atop your mantel.\r\n",

      "LongDescription": "The Call of the Wild You heard it, and your instincts told you it must be answered. The last bar on your\r\n   cell phone disappears as you drive into the foothills, all of your worries far behind\r\n   in the rearview mirror. Miles from civilization, not even your cornflower-blue-shirt-wearing\r\n   boss Tad can encroach on your weekend. You're off the grid.\r\nThe untamed wilderness is your proving ground. After all, there's no greater challenge\r\n   than that of Man against the Elements.\r\n The Great Outdoors It's just you and an overgrown hinterland seething with insects and wild animals -\r\n  just the way you like it. With only a few hours\r\n   of daylight left, you set out in search of a suitable campsite.\r\n Paul Bunyan had an axe and an ox, but you have a 5-in-1 multi-tool. You\r\n   wield it with the strength and precision of a grizzled mountaineer. At this rate, it's only a matter of\r\n   time before you trade in your sleeping bag for a log cabin, but you need to set up camp before something\r\n   mistakes you for dinner.\r\n You're a descendant of Man, and Man discovered fire. Yours is crackling merrily in no time with a few\r\n   strikes of your firestarter.

The Revolutionary War MVP and celebrity endorser of\r\n   the one dollar bill knew that no amount of prestige or accomplishments could rival\r\n   the warm satisfaction of a good glass of whiskey.\r\n</p> <p>In days past, a man's fondness for whiskey was admirably brandished in full home bars, but in modern times,\r\n   whiskey is hidden out of sight in cabinets and desk drawers like shameful secrets. The Whiskey Appreciation\r\n   Crate is here to restore honor to the once great bond between a man and his drink.\r\n</p> <h4>Oh, yes we de-can!</h4> <p>Etching your initials into a glass decanter is a public declaration of your affinity for whiskey.\r\n   It's like donning a trenchcoat and holding a boombox overhead blasting Peter Gabriel's\r\n   \"In Your Eyes\" outside of whiskey's house or barging past the TSA checkpoint to frantically\r\n   sprint through the airport terminal for a last second  whiskey\r\n   before boarding your plane.\r\n</p> <p>While the monogrammed decanter looks super classy when flanked by its matching pair of personalized\r\n   rocks tumblers, whiskey should be appraised by taste as well as  presentation. The decanter properly\r\n   aerates and settles your whiskey so you can settle down with a glass of good company anytime.\r\n</p> <h4>Good Company</h4> <p>Rounding out the Whiskey Appreciation Crate is the ultimate whiskey connoisseur collection: A pair of\r\n   Tovolo Ice Molds and slate coasters, a pocket-sized whiskey tasting journal, and the most important whiskey\r\n   accessory, premium savory snacks.\r\n</p> <p>Box up those dusty sports trophies and find a stud to hang your awkward family portraits, because the\r\n   Personalized Whiskey Decanter is reclaiming whiskey's proper place atop your mantel.\r\n</p>",

Glaze right over the blaze with the silicone\r\n   basting brush, heat-safe to 550 degrees, and top off the cast-iron sauce pan with\r\n   fine selections from the  Sauce Boss himself, Mr. Rufus Teague.\r\n</p> <p>Teague's Honey Sweet and Touch of Heat flavors bring the bottled best of Kansas City to your cookout,\r\n   the perfect complement to a base-taste layer of his famed meat rub.

That social production of masculinity is a bit much even by our\r\n   standards--unless you're Australian, in which case... good onya, mate!\r\n</p> <p>There's a case to be made for subtlety, and routinely carrying a folding knife is the perfect\r\n   balance of convenience, preparation, and discretion.

There are more evening cocktail occasions than you can shake a swizzle stick at. But one rather mundane morning we got to thinking, why should nighttime have all the fun?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the plan is to wake and slake with an a.m.-friendly libation, it's best to follow in the staggery footsteps of writer/drinker Ernest Hemingway. The literary legend actually helped popularize the Bloody Mary in the 1920s, giving the world a buzzy brunch beverage that is unequivocally more refreshing when the sun is shining. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Storied Sunrise Cocktail Crate is the ultimate homage to \"Papa,\" pairing a smoke-infused Bloody Mary mix with a copy of his debut novel, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>. Mornings for the thinking and drinking man are about to get a lot brighter. Take that, moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Proper Reading and Drinking Materials </h4>\r\n<li>Considered one of Hemingway's best novels, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> is a poignant tale about the meaning of life. Except for the knock-knock joke on page 47.</li>\r\n<li>Make it personal with a set of 2 laser-engraved mason jars that are almost as thick as the book.</li>\r\n<li>Smokin' Mary Bloody Mary Mix is made for foodies by foodies. Because a well-made Bloody is practically a meal in itself.</li>\r\n<li>Celery sticks are for, well, we're really not sure. But the Foster's Pickled Green Beans we've included will garnish the heck of his cocktail.</li>",

Even Da Vinci, the quintessential Renaissance man, would've just been\n   another creepy Mona Lisa hanger-on if not for the proper equipment.

The Premium Cigar Humidor innovates on their enlightened methods by\n   featuring a double-guillotine cutter. It will give your cigars a cleaner straight cut than a 1950's Wall\n   Street barber shop and deliver a smoking experience that will make your head roll.\n</p> <p>We don't take cigar lighting lightly either. Cheap old lighter? Might as well wash your stogie down with a\n   shot of lighter fluid. Ignite the good life by flipping open a Thunderbird Butane torch just like your\n   father and his father once did.\n</p> <h4>Gear on the Go</h4> <p>With a custom-designed hygrometer and humidifier fitted into the lid, the air-tight, indestructible Ammo\n   Can Humidor is the perfect tobacco tackle box. It's the only traveling humidor that\n   guarantees both regulation of ideal moisture levels and preservation in the event\n   of a nuclear holocaust.\n</p> <p>Don't just blow hot air around, grab the Premium Cigar Humidor and become a cigar connoisseur.</p>",

There's just\n   something exhilarating about expertly dragging an extremely sharp blade across the\n   face, staring danger straight in the face with a smooth, straight-shaved face to\n   show for it.\n</p> <p>For generations, a trusty straight razor has brought out the best in men, both inside and out.</p> <h4>Solingen for the Win</h4> <p>The Straight Shave Project Kit features a handmade 4/8\" Böker straight razor forged in Solingen,\n   Germany, the revered City of Blades. The esteemed \"made in Solingen\" title is strictly\n   reserved for blades made in and subjected to that region's rigorous quality standards,\n   just like Scotch Whiskey, Champagne Sparkling Wine, or Hidden Valley Ranch.\n</p> <p>This top-notch face scraper boasts Anthracite handles and a carbon steel blade\n   with extra hollow ground for extreme sharpness and edge retention. It can be aligned\n   and sharpened against either side of the Böker leather span strop, the paste composite\n   for rough stropping or natural leather for fine stropping.\n</p> <h4>Refined Renegade</h4> <p>While we're not always the most selective about what we put on our face, we exercise major discretion\n   regarding what gets on our razor. Renegade Shave products make the cut.\n</p> <p>Renegade shave creams primes the face for a close, comfortable shave, and the Alum Bar and After Shave\n   soothes any wounds and face nicks made from the shaky hands of straight razor excitement. The result, a\n   clean shave and an amazing smelling 6-8 inches between the nose and shoulders.\n</p> <p>The Straight Shave Project Kit is giving men a sleek new handle on the sensation of old-fashioned\n   shaving.\n</p>",
