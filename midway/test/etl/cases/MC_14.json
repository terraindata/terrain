      "LongDescription": "The Right Tools for the Job There's a line that separates the amateurs from the professionals. It's certainly\r\n   in the training and the experience, but folks often forget about the importance\r\n   of your equipment. Just like you can't win a NASCAR Cup in your grocery-getter,\r\n   can't crush a golf ball into orbit without a high-end driver, and aren't going\r\n   to take a trophy buck without a zeroed-in tack-driver, your grilling game will never\r\n   go next level without the right gear. You gotta have the right tools for the job.\r\n Like a Grill-ionaire Fortunately, you don't need to shell out a mountain of cash to get the equipment you need to get you to\r\n   grilling nirvana. We've included some of the best accessories that every man needs to get that Grillionaire\r\n   status.\r\n Our Grill Master Man Crate includes a cast-iron smoker\r\n  box and some hickory wood chips to get you started. Set the smoker box on\r\n   the grill as it warms up, soak the hickory in some water, and drop 'em into the\r\n   box as your meat grills. Take note, men: real flavor shouldn't come from a bottled\r\n   labeled \"liquid smoke.\"\r\n We threw in a set of four  steak thermometers, too. You may say, \"hey, Team\r\n   Man Crates, isn't that cheating?\" And we say, \"nay.\" There's no dishonor in knowing how done your steak\r\n   is. And when you cut into a perfectly-cooked slab of beef, you too shall understand that G.I. Joe wasn't\r\n   kidding when he said that Knowing Is Half the Battle.\r\n And because \"the right tool for every job\" means that sometimes you'll require some brute force, we've\r\n   included a brass-knuckle meat tenderizer. Nothing blows off the steam from a\r\n   long, hard day at work like beating your meat into submission.\r\n Bone Doctors We search tirelessly, every day, to find the best-in-class goods to put in our crates. Hundreds of sauces\r\n   came and went, the grills burned for weeks, until finally a victor emerged. An unexpected dark\r\n   horse, a little-known operation out of Virginia became the Cinderella story of the\r\n   Man Crates grilling taste-off. We proudly present Bone Doctors'\r\n  BBQ sauces, pair of masterpiece sauces and a brilliant spice blend.\r\n So fire up the grill, and call your agent: after all, you're about to go pro.",

It's certainly\r\n   in the training and the experience, but folks often forget about the importance\r\n   of your equipment. Just like you can't win a NASCAR Cup in your grocery-getter,\r\n   can't crush a golf ball into orbit without a high-end driver, and aren't going\r\n   to take a trophy buck without a zeroed-in tack-driver, your grilling game will never\r\n   go next level without the right gear. You gotta have the right tools for the job.\r\n</p> <h4>Like a Grill-ionaire</h4> <p>Fortunately, you don't need to shell out a mountain of cash to get the equipment you need to get you to\r\n   grilling nirvana. We've included some of the best accessories that every man needs to get that Grillionaire\r\n   status.\r\n</p> <p>Our Grill Master Man Crate includes a cast-iron smoker\r\n  box and some hickory wood chips to get you started. Set the smoker box on\r\n   the grill as it warms up, soak the hickory in some water, and drop 'em into the\r\n   box as your meat grills. Take note, men: real flavor shouldn't come from a bottled\r\n   labeled \"liquid smoke.\"\r\n</p> <p>We threw in a set of four  steak thermometers, too. You may say, \"hey, Team\r\n   Man Crates, isn't that cheating?\" And we say, \"nay.\" There's no dishonor in knowing how done your steak\r\n   is. And when you cut into a perfectly-cooked slab of beef, you too shall understand that G.I. Joe wasn't\r\n   kidding when he said that Knowing Is Half the Battle.\r\n</p> <p>And because \"the right tool for every job\" means that sometimes you'll require some brute force, we've\r\n   included a brass-knuckle meat tenderizer. Nothing blows off the steam from a\r\n   long, hard day at work like beating your meat into submission.\r\n</p> <h4>Bone Doctors</h4> <p>We search tirelessly, every day, to find the best-in-class goods to put in our crates. Hundreds of sauces\r\n   came and went, the grills burned for weeks, until finally a victor emerged. An unexpected dark\r\n   horse, a little-known operation out of Virginia became the Cinderella story of the\r\n   Man Crates grilling taste-off. We proudly present Bone Doctors'\r\n  BBQ sauces, pair of masterpiece sauces and a brilliant spice blend.\r\n</p> <p>So fire up the grill, and call your agent: after all, you're about to go pro.</p>",

History itself attests to the fact that the most delicious pizzas are\r\n   born of fire.\r\n</p> <p>The Great Fire of Rome in 64 A.D. led to the creation of pozzolanic\r\n   concrete, and thus, crispy flatbread crust. New York's 1835 brick building bonfire\r\n   inspired brick oven pizza, and deep dish style emerged after the widespread fear\r\n   of wood from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\r\n</p> <p>The Pizza Grilling Crate transforms the destructive flames of a backyard grill into the source of life for\r\n   delicious, stone-grilled pizza.\r\n</p> <h4>From The Fire, We Feast!</h4> <p>The Pizza Grilling Crate turns any ordinary grill into a flame-fueled furnace for crisp, smoky pizza.\r\n   The four cordierite baking stones bring the heat to any personal pizza party, but\r\n   can also be fitted together to grill pizza pies of all sizes and shapes, including\r\n   all seven Tetris shapes.\r\n</p> <p>For simple homemade, hand-tossed pizza crust, Passione is the dough you knead. This organic artisanal flour\r\n   ground from premium hard red wheat makes amazing pizza that will have every man kissing his fingers in a\r\n   grandiose manner, proclaiming \"Delizioso!\" in an exaggerated, possibly-offensive Italian accent.\r\n</p> <h4>Hot Off The Blocks</h4> <p>The double-down dough roller swiftly lays a level base for the whopping of toppings that can and should\r\n   cover the pizza. We're also including Pizzacraft's authentic Neapolitan herb blend and cookbook, the primer\r\n   on all things pizza with over 100 pages of recipes and resources.\r\n</p> <p>Finally, we've custom-designed a collapsible pizza peel that transfers piping hot pies from\r\n   the grill to the table with all toppings in tact.\r\n</p> <p>Like gold, steel, and the rest of civilization's most indispensable elements, pizza is best forged in fire. </p> <p><sup>*</sup>All historical accuracy subject to interpretation.</p>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>Time To Fire Up The Grill</h4> <p>At some point in time during the dark and dirty and, let's be honest, hairy history\r\n   of our species, an innovator was born. Tired of eating cold, raw mammoth meat, that enterprising caveman invented fire, and before you\r\n   can grunt \"ugg,\" he had thrown a piece of meat on it and invented grilling.\r\n</p> <h4>Smoking</h4> <p>We love ourselves a good grilled steak. But sometimes, it's nice to mix it up.\r\n   And if you're like us, you've wanted to try smoking your choice of dead animal\r\n   for some time but are leery of making the investment in a dedicated smoker.\r\n</p> <p>Well, we found ourselves a solution, and we loved it so much that we built a\r\n   crate around it so that you, too, could enjoy the pleasures of smoking without having\r\n   to drop a few Benjamins on a new toy. The cast-iron smoker\r\n  box in this crate will quickly become your weapon-of-choice. Just set the\r\n   smoker box onto the grill as it heats up, soak some of the hickory wood chips we've\r\n   helpfully provided, and throw them into the box. Your steaks will come out tasting\r\n   like victory. It's not just for steak, either. For maximum win, try finding some\r\n   cedar chips and throwing them in next time you grill some seafood, or some mesquite\r\n   when you grill pork chops. Your palate will thank you.\r\n</p> <h4>Extra Flavors &amp; Snacks</h4> <p>We included some of our favorite rubs, steak and barbecue sauces\r\n   to take your smoking habit to the next level. And since being grill-master is an\r\n   arduous, thankless job that involves staring at food for ages before being able\r\n   to eat it, we included some snacks to keep your stomach happy and quiet and your\r\n   mind focused on the task at hand.\r\n</p> <p>So throw a steak on the fire, and crack a beer in honor of your caveman forefathers. After all, you may not\r\n   have invented grilling, but you're damn sure on your way to perfecting\r\n  it.\r\n</p>",

This great wisdom was called \"barbecue\", and it\r\n   pleased the gods so greatly that they indulged...perhaps a bit too much.\r\n</p> <p>The Woolies are long gone, but the archaic secrets of True Barbecue live on in the Pit Master Man Crate. </p> <h4>Heat, Eat, Repeat</h4> <p>The Pit Master Crate is the Mr.  Miyagi of barbecue gear, your guiding\r\n   sensei on the road to fall-off-the-bone, \"low &amp; slow\" True Barbecue mastery.\r\n</p> <p>Meat Claws are the supreme tools for lifting and lugging huge roasts, whether you've dug a backyard pit to\r\n   \"go whole hog\" or drained and lined your swimming pool to \"go whole herd\". Knuckle up with these stainless\r\n   steel shredders, and you're just a few impassioned Wolverine impressions\r\n   away from pristine pulled pork.\r\n</p> <p>Keep your eyebrows intact with the collapsible barbecue fork, or go face to the fire with premium leather\r\n   gloves intended to handle the densest meat and most intense heat.\r\n</p> <h4>Sauce Like A Boss</h4> <p>A poorly executed saucing strategy can make or break your barbecue, and we're\r\n   firmly in the \"sauce while hot\" camp. Glaze right over the blaze with the silicone\r\n   basting brush, heat-safe to 550 degrees, and top off the cast-iron sauce pan with\r\n   fine selections from the  Sauce Boss himself, Mr. Rufus Teague.\r\n</p> <p>Teague's Honey Sweet and Touch of Heat flavors bring the bottled best of Kansas City to your cookout,\r\n   the perfect complement to a base-taste layer of his famed meat rub. Seal the deal\r\n   with a pro-style smokestack of hickory wood chips.\r\n</p> <p>Open up the pit with the Pit Master Crate, and unlock the secrets of True Barbecue.</p>",

We think the world of their graceful agility, grandiose color\r\n   patterns, and overall trustworthy character.\r\n</p> <p>They are beautiful, emotionally-complex creatures, and if there was a way we could enjoy their delicious\r\n   meaty insides without angling and gutting them, we would. Alas, the universe is cruel, and the best we can\r\n   do is give them a most honorable end.\r\n</p> <h4>A Fresh, Flavorful Farewell</h4> <p>To make their journey into eternal slumber as comfortable as possible for the fisher and the fished,\r\n   we've selected a Canvas Creel with a waterproof lining and breathable mesh sides.

For the trout traditionalists, the zesty citrus O'Fish'ial Blend Trout\r\n   Seasoning ensures every trout reaches its finest flavor potential in life and beyond.\r\n</p> <p>We've unlocked the mysteries of supreme trout flavor in our tell-all book of ingenious meal\r\n   creations--TROUT: Avant-Garde Recipes for the Trout Enthusiast.

Whatever the predator\r\n   and whatever the prey, the Hunting Crate ensures you'll be the most dangerous creature\r\n   of all.\r\n</p> <h4>Keep Comfort In The Crosshairs</h4> <p>The Stanley extra large insulated bottle is the same classic style, stainless steel flask our grandpas\r\n   handed down to us, except without the bullet nicks from storming Normandy. Its vacuum insulation\r\n   keeps hot things hot and cold things cold for 28 hours, perfect for keeping coffee\r\n   piping hot from one morning to the next or for use as decoy bait for heat-seeking\r\n   predators.\r\n</p> <p>The Tac-Force TF-469 Folding Knife has everything needed for unzipping and grilling the freshest steak\r\n   dinner imaginable: a stainless gut hook blade, silicone grip ring, hard nylon sheath, fire starter, diamond\r\n   honing file, and bottle opener. And if Mother Nature is being a real downer, the capsule of stormproof\r\n   matches will light in even the worst of circumstances.\r\n</p> <h4>Unseen and Unscented</h4> <p>For starters, the camo form wrap and facepaint disguises anyone and anything as slightly\r\n   off-grey splotches by which animals see the world. But invisible isn't enough to\r\n   be utterly undetectable to the heightened senses of predator and prey.\r\n</p> <p>Duke Cannon's Big Ol' Brick of Hunting Soap will wash any whiff of human clean off your\r\n   body. It's like those Axe body spray commercials when, once applied, beautiful women\r\n   ambush the man out of sheer desire, except instead of ambushing him, they'll completely\r\n   ignore him. And instead of beautiful women, it's a moose.\r\n</p> <p>It's a hunt or be hunted world, and the Hunting Crate equips you to always be atop the food chain.</p>",
