      "LongDescription": "On Romance Some have called love a many splendored thing, others a battlefield. We call it confusing. It's not that we don't get romance; the thrill of being showered by sweet nothings and\r\n   also actual swoon-inducing gifts and makes total sense. It's just, we don't get\r\n   anything we find romantic. Truth be told, a tub of bubbles and a pocketful of fancy\r\n   chocolates doesn't really kickstart the ol' emotion-maker.\r\n But the tides of tender affection are turning, and the male heart can now be cut loose from where\r\n   it's been hanging high and dry all these years. The romanced man has a new champion\r\n   in the Jerky Heart.\r\n The Art of Meaty Romance The Jerky Heart is a wholly-savory, hyper-sensual meat surprise of affection and flavor.

The romanced man has a new\r\n   champion in the Exotic Jerky Heart.\r\n The Art of Meaty Romance The Exotic Jerky Heart is a wholly-savory, hyper-sensual meat surprise of affection\r\n   and flavor.\r\n Spring the perfect romantic rouse with a sappy, heart-shaped box suggesting the tiresome chocolates of\r\n   every year. But upon opening, his humdrum expectations and coarse, emotional exterior will be melted away\r\n   by a passionate gesture of jerky.\r\n There's no sentiment words can convey that exotic jerkies can't, but we'll still print your blush-worthy\r\n   message of tender affection inside the box--right next to ten knee-weakening flavors of tender exotic\r\n   animal strips like Honey Bourbon Elk, Black Pepper Gator, and Root Beer Habanero Venison.\r\n Put the \"man\" back in romance with a total heart-sweller that charms him in his most fluent language:\r\n   savory, seasoned beef jerky!\r\n",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>The Fathers of Flavor</h4> <p>The mainstream media and its biases toward hygiene, clear articulation, and pants have\r\n   always been a bit harsh on our cavemen ancestors. So their cave paintings weren't\r\n   intentionally \"abstract\", and sure, they couldn't count past five without setting\r\n   down their club, but cavemen weren't the total, no-brain nitwits they're constantly\r\n   perceived to be.\r\n</p> <p>The Caveman Crate celebrates our foreheaded forefathers' finest food contributions to modern humanity: the\r\n   discovery of nuts and meat.\r\n</p> <h4>Prehistoric Taste Test</h4> <p>There's a reason humans don't eat anything and everything in existence, and it's not for lack of trying.\r\n   It's because those \"crude, lumbering\" cavemen of old performed a thorough, detailed taste-analysis on every\r\n   species and substance on the planet: sorting the good from the gross, the safe from the poisonous, the\r\n   tasty from the soy-based, gluten-free vegan alternatives.\r\n</p> <p>The neanderthals were our nutritional trailblazers, hunting and sampling every creature to ensure no taste\r\n   was left untested. The best of beasts became the jerky bedrock for the developing civilization, namely:\r\n   buffalo, cattle, turkey, and deer.\r\n</p> <p>We've hand-selected four quality packs of seasoned jerky meat from these delicious\r\n   species to demonstrate how far mankind has progressed in flavor and to instill gratitude\r\n   toward the brave cavemen that brought us here.\r\n</p> <h4>Nothing But Nuts</h4> <p>Besides meat, our paleolithic parents also consumed wild almonds and cashews, with \"wild\"\r\n   being a flavor dependent upon the nearby water, weeds, and waste. While sending\r\n   these same primitive \"flavors\" would be the best way to fully appreciate the sacrifices\r\n   our cavefathers made, for safety and satisfaction reasons, we've opted to instead\r\n   include the best of the modern nut spectrum: Toffee Butter Almonds and Citrus Chili\r\n   Cashews.\r\n</p> <p>The Caveman Crate is our best way of paying homage to our food roots,\r\n   the original sustenance explorers that became our fathers of flavor.\r\n</p>",

It's certainly\r\n   in the training and the experience, but folks often forget about the importance\r\n   of your equipment. Just like you can't win a NASCAR Cup in your grocery-getter,\r\n   can't crush a golf ball into orbit without a high-end driver, and aren't going\r\n   to take a trophy buck without a zeroed-in tack-driver, your grilling game will never\r\n   go next level without the right gear. You gotta have the right tools for the job.\r\n</p> <h4>Like a Grill-ionaire</h4> <p>Fortunately, you don't need to shell out a mountain of cash to get the equipment you need to get you to\r\n   grilling nirvana. We've included some of the best accessories that every man needs to get that Grillionaire\r\n   status.\r\n</p> <p>Our Grill Master Man Crate includes a cast-iron smoker\r\n  box and some hickory wood chips to get you started. Set the smoker box on\r\n   the grill as it warms up, soak the hickory in some water, and drop 'em into the\r\n   box as your meat grills. Take note, men: real flavor shouldn't come from a bottled\r\n   labeled \"liquid smoke.\"\r\n</p> <p>We threw in a set of four  steak thermometers, too. You may say, \"hey, Team\r\n   Man Crates, isn't that cheating?\" And we say, \"nay.\" There's no dishonor in knowing how done your steak\r\n   is. And when you cut into a perfectly-cooked slab of beef, you too shall understand that G.I. Joe wasn't\r\n   kidding when he said that Knowing Is Half the Battle.\r\n</p> <p>And because \"the right tool for every job\" means that sometimes you'll require some brute force, we've\r\n   included a brass-knuckle meat tenderizer. Nothing blows off the steam from a\r\n   long, hard day at work like beating your meat into submission.\r\n</p> <h4>Bone Doctors</h4> <p>We search tirelessly, every day, to find the best-in-class goods to put in our crates. Hundreds of sauces\r\n   came and went, the grills burned for weeks, until finally a victor emerged. An unexpected dark\r\n   horse, a little-known operation out of Virginia became the Cinderella story of the\r\n   Man Crates grilling taste-off. We proudly present Bone Doctors'\r\n  BBQ sauces, pair of masterpiece sauces and a brilliant spice blend.\r\n</p> <p>So fire up the grill, and call your agent: after all, you're about to go pro.</p>",

History itself attests to the fact that the most delicious pizzas are\r\n   born of fire.\r\n</p> <p>The Great Fire of Rome in 64 A.D. led to the creation of pozzolanic\r\n   concrete, and thus, crispy flatbread crust. New York's 1835 brick building bonfire\r\n   inspired brick oven pizza, and deep dish style emerged after the widespread fear\r\n   of wood from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\r\n</p> <p>The Pizza Grilling Crate transforms the destructive flames of a backyard grill into the source of life for\r\n   delicious, stone-grilled pizza.\r\n</p> <h4>From The Fire, We Feast!</h4> <p>The Pizza Grilling Crate turns any ordinary grill into a flame-fueled furnace for crisp, smoky pizza.\r\n   The four cordierite baking stones bring the heat to any personal pizza party, but\r\n   can also be fitted together to grill pizza pies of all sizes and shapes, including\r\n   all seven Tetris shapes.\r\n</p> <p>For simple homemade, hand-tossed pizza crust, Passione is the dough you knead. This organic artisanal flour\r\n   ground from premium hard red wheat makes amazing pizza that will have every man kissing his fingers in a\r\n   grandiose manner, proclaiming \"Delizioso!\" in an exaggerated, possibly-offensive Italian accent.\r\n</p> <h4>Hot Off The Blocks</h4> <p>The double-down dough roller swiftly lays a level base for the whopping of toppings that can and should\r\n   cover the pizza. We're also including Pizzacraft's authentic Neapolitan herb blend and cookbook, the primer\r\n   on all things pizza with over 100 pages of recipes and resources.\r\n</p> <p>Finally, we've custom-designed a collapsible pizza peel that transfers piping hot pies from\r\n   the grill to the table with all toppings in tact.\r\n</p> <p>Like gold, steel, and the rest of civilization's most indispensable elements, pizza is best forged in fire. </p> <p><sup>*</sup>All historical accuracy subject to interpretation.</p>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>America's Next Top Chef Idol</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The backyard grill is far more than a means of searing meats. It's center stage to serve up a platter full of critical acclaim. When flame meets steak, so ignites the fantasy of being head chef at a high-end steakhouse. Cue the dream sequence. Diddle-diddle-duh, diddle-diddle-duh...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amid plumes of pillowy smoke, he's harshly judging the imperfect grill marks of an innocent filet mignon like a certain acerbic, British celebrity chef. He then reaches for the Backyard Steakhouse Crate's essential grilling tools and exclusive steak sauces. A surgical steak flip here, a brilliant brush stroke there...and succulent steak worthy of a Michelin rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fame and nationwide franchises are sure to follow when he's cooking with the Backyard Steakhouse Crate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Everything but the Poofy, White Hat</h4> \r\n<li>When he unrolls his tote holding his Oval Pro Chef" 3-Piece Tool Set that's your cue to start your standing ovation.</li>\r\n<li>Donning the black denim grilling apron will instantly command respect from hungry family members, nosy neighbors, and scurrying squirrels.</li>\r\n<li>We've got an in with legendary flavor maven Rufus Teague. You won't find this set of Steak Lovers sauces and rubs anywhere else. Not even in Rufus's kitchen.</li>\r\n<li>The Safe Scrape wooden scraping paddle gradually conforms to the shape of the grill's grates to banish charred debris from the cooking surface. Talk about a grate escrape.</li>\r\n</ul>",

The fall of such docile beasts have given rise to our stampede of\r\n   inebriated beef, the Booze-Infused Jerky Crate.\r\n</p> <h4>A Cow Walks Into A Bar...</h4> <p>By weight, the average-sized cow can down 57 standard drinks per hour (almost 1 per minute) and still be\r\n   within the legal limits of operating a vehicle or motorized tractor.\r\n</p> <p>At maximum capacity, the average cow's four stomachs can hold upwards of 62 gallons of liquid,\r\n   more than a barrel of Jack Daniels (53 gallons). If only that were enough alcohol\r\n   to satiate their demons.\r\n</p> <p>The good news is, this means the tender beef of the Booze-Infused Jerky Crate has been marinating in a\r\n   saloon's worth of alcohol (from the inside-out) for the better half of a bovine lifetime. The results,\r\n   delicious, buzzed beef jerky.\r\n</p> <h4>Go Home Beef Jerky, You're Drunk</h4> <p>In curing Cowcaholism, we didn't just cure the easy-capture, beer-bellied beef bodies. We\r\n   herded up cows with diversified tastes from Whiskey BBQ to Pinot Noir for a wide\r\n   spectrum of alcohol flavors for your jerky fix.\r\n</p> <p>The full lineup of cattle intoxication includes: Caribbean Rum, IPA, Cabernet, Bourbon, Whiskey BBQ,\r\n   Chipotle Tequila, Dark Ale, and Regrained IPA and Coffee Stout bars to act as a quick brunch/hangover\r\n   cure.\r\n</p> <p>Throwdown a double-shot of beef and booze in one bite with the Booze-Infused Jerky Crate.</p>",

We call it confusing.</p> <p>It's not that we don't get romance; the thrill of being showered by sweet nothings\r\n   and also actual swoon-inducing gifts and makes total sense. It's just, we don't\r\n   get anything we find romantic. Truth be told, a tub of bubbles and a pocketful of\r\n   fancy chocolates doesn't really kickstart the ol' emotion-maker.\r\n</p> <p>But the tides of tender affection are turning, and the male heart can now be cut loose from\r\n   where it's been hanging high and dry all these years. The romanced man has a new\r\n   champion in the Exotic Jerky Heart.\r\n</p> <h4>The Art of Meaty Romance</h4> <p>The Exotic Jerky Heart is a wholly-savory, hyper-sensual meat surprise of affection\r\n   and flavor.\r\n</p> <p>Spring the perfect romantic rouse with a sappy, heart-shaped box suggesting the tiresome chocolates of\r\n   every year. But upon opening, his humdrum expectations and coarse, emotional exterior will be melted away\r\n   by a passionate gesture of jerky.\r\n</p> <p>There's no sentiment words can convey that exotic jerkies can't, but we'll still print your blush-worthy\r\n   message of tender affection inside the box--right next to ten knee-weakening flavors of tender exotic\r\n   animal strips like Honey Bourbon Elk, Black Pepper Gator, and Root Beer Habanero Venison.\r\n</p> <p>Put the \"man\" back in romance with a total heart-sweller that charms him in his most fluent language:\r\n   savory, seasoned beef jerky!\r\n</p>",
