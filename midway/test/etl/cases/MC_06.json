They celebrated their dominance over nature like true men--by cracking\r\n   open a beer and chiseling their names into the icy death they'd conquered.\r\n A man's name isn't just a label. It's a shorthand celebration of his greatest accomplishments. This Time It's Personal Sure, Barry from high school, voted \"Most Likely to Succeed,\" might drive a fancy European sports car to\r\n   his fat cat Wall Street job, but does Barry from high school have his own set of personalized pint glasses?\r\n Probably not. He probably drinks from non-personalized glasses like an uncultured chump.  We've acquired that monstrous laser from \"Goldfinger\" and repurposed its settings from burning James Bond's\r\n   giblets to etching names into pint glasses with perfect precision.\r\n So while Barry's crying alone in his mansion over a frozen microwave dinner, you can be toasting real\r\n   success with three close buddies and four awesome personalized pint glasses.\r\n The Man, The Myth, The Legendary Coasters The matching set of personalized wooden coasters are classy and clean--like drying your tabletops with bear\r\n   skin napkins. Plus, they double as bottle-openers, which means less time scavenging in drawers and more\r\n   time swapping epic drinking stories. Like when you once wrestled a croc while wearing Crocs purely out of\r\n   hubris.\r\n And we've got snacks with your name on them. Figuratively. We used to personalize every individual nut and\r\n   pretzel, but they got inhaled too quickly for anyone to notice.\r\n Grab the Personalized Barware Crate today and ensure the world never forgets your name.",

In short this tool is basically the golfer's equivalent to\r\n   the iPhone. Of all the tagalongs, gadgets and golf widgets we tried, the DivPro stood out as an incredibly\r\n   well-designed, practical item.\r\n A bag of tees, a sleeve of TaylorMade Long &amp; Softs, and an ever-useful golf towel round out the\r\n   practical items in the Golfer's Man Crate.

The fall of such docile beasts have given rise to our stampede of\r\n   inebriated beef, the Booze-Infused Jerky Crate.\r\n A Cow Walks Into A Bar... By weight, the average-sized cow can down 57 standard drinks per hour (almost 1 per minute) and still be\r\n   within the legal limits of operating a vehicle or motorized tractor.\r\n At maximum capacity, the average cow's four stomachs can hold upwards of 62 gallons of liquid,\r\n   more than a barrel of Jack Daniels (53 gallons). If only that were enough alcohol\r\n   to satiate their demons.\r\n The good news is, this means the tender beef of the Booze-Infused Jerky Crate has been marinating in a\r\n   saloon's worth of alcohol (from the inside-out) for the better half of a bovine lifetime.

It's a shorthand celebration of his greatest accomplishments.</p> <h4>This Time It's Personal</h4> <p>Sure, Barry from high school, voted \"Most Likely to Succeed,\" might drive a fancy European sports car to\r\n   his fat cat Wall Street job, but does Barry from high school have his own set of personalized pint glasses?\r\n</p> <p>Probably not. He probably drinks from non-personalized glasses like an uncultured chump. </p> <p>We've acquired that monstrous laser from \"Goldfinger\" and repurposed its settings from burning James Bond's\r\n   giblets to etching names into pint glasses with perfect precision.\r\n</p> <p>So while Barry's crying alone in his mansion over a frozen microwave dinner, you can be toasting real\r\n   success with three close buddies and four awesome personalized pint glasses.\r\n</p> <h4>The Man, The Myth, The Legendary Coasters</h4> <p>The matching set of personalized wooden coasters are classy and clean--like drying your tabletops with bear\r\n   skin napkins. Plus, they double as bottle-openers, which means less time scavenging in drawers and more\r\n   time swapping epic drinking stories. Like when you once wrestled a croc while wearing Crocs purely out of\r\n   hubris.\r\n</p> <p>And we've got snacks with your name on them. Figuratively. We used to personalize every individual nut and\r\n   pretzel, but they got inhaled too quickly for anyone to notice.\r\n</p> <p>Grab the Personalized Barware Crate today and ensure the world never forgets your name.</p>",

We've never been on the amateur circuit, we've never won any charity tournaments,\r\n   and Michelle Wie's people won't return our phone calls. Hell, we'll even admit that when we first started R&amp;D\r\n   on the Golfer's Man Crate we were sloppy on the driving range and an embarrassment on the course.\r\n</p> <p>Luckily after weeks of sampling just about every golf product on the market and\r\n   many long days of practice, we're no worse off. We had tons of fun, but we're\r\n   still absolutely mediocre golfers.\r\n</p> <p>Expensive gadgets didn't make us better golfers any more than expensive boxing gloves would\r\n   make us better heavy-weight prize fighters. We've got no shortcuts to sell you\r\n   to improve your game, but we have gathered a few awesome items that make any golf\r\n   outing more fun.\r\n</p> <h4>The Game Within A Game</h4> <p>Whether your preferred sidebet is cold, hard, \"In God We Trust\" cash or the penalty of a shotgunned beer,\r\n   there is no purer way to celebrate living in a free capitalist society than by making\r\n   a handshake wager on a spur of the moment challenge. It's in the drama of these\r\n   small contests that heroes are born and legends are written.\r\n</p> <p>Enter the Chuck Rodent golf head cover. This stylish piece of golf haute\r\n   couture isn't just a beautifully functional adornment for your club, it's the trophy of a champion.\r\n   Wager Chuck Rodent on the next best-ball drive and the winner gets to carry him in his bag. The loser\r\n   becomes \"the gopher\", responsible for fetching lost balls and drinks until he can win or steal Chuck back.\r\n</p> <p>If you do end up having to shotgun that beer, the 6 Tool DivPro\r\n   will come in handy. It also comes in handy if you need to fix a divot, hold your club off the green, ash a\r\n   cigar, mark your ball, or clean your club heads. In short this tool is basically the golfer's equivalent to\r\n   the iPhone. Of all the tagalongs, gadgets and golf widgets we tried, the DivPro stood out as an incredibly\r\n   well-designed, practical item.\r\n</p> <p>A bag of tees, a sleeve of TaylorMade Long &amp; Softs, and an ever-useful golf towel round out the\r\n   practical items in the Golfer's Man Crate. Always have a towel. For sustenance on the course we've thrown\r\n   in some sunflower seeds and a classic Arnold Palmer.\r\n</p> <h4>Bill Freakin' Murray</h4> <p>We can't send you private golf lessons, but we will send you the definitive instructional DVD on the\r\n   golfer's way of life. Critics agree that Caddyshack is an absolutely\r\n  juvenile exploration of man's struggle to find his place in the world amidst the pressures of his\r\n   environment, fearsome wildlife, and cut-throat competition- one of the most rewatched comedies of all time.\r\n</p>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>Kicks Like A Mule</h4> <p>We love mixed drinks almost as much as we love America, so we were extra relieved to learn\n   the Moscow Mule was very American and not, as we initially suspected, a delicious\n   brainwashing potion created by a certain shirtless, horse-riding Russian overlord.\n</p> <p>Our research shows the Moscow Mule went from cellar dweller to celebrity socialite\n   overnight by combining ginger beer, vodka, lime, and good ol' American moxie.\n</p> <h4>The Rise and Fall of the Moscow Mule</h4> <p>In 1941, Vodka was unknown and unwanted in America. Smirnoff owner John Martin had to store his unsellable\n   alcohol in the Cock N' Bull, a bar owned by Martin's equally bland-named friend Jack Morgan.\n   In an effort to clear out the basement, the bartender began mixing Smirnoff with\n   Morgan's unpopular ginger beer in mugs from his girlfriend's failed copper factory.\n</p> <p>It was a risky move to toss a bunch of undesirable things together and re-sell\n   it (scientists call this The Hot Dog Phenomena), but the strategy was an overwhelming\n   success. Soon, every trendsetter in Tinseltown was posing for the Polaroid paparazzi\n   with a copper mug in hand.\n</p> <p>Sadly, nothing copper can stay, and when the Cold War hit in the 1950's, true blue Americans began\n   boycotting vodka, aka \"Communist Tap Water\". The Moscow Mule faded into obscurity.\n</p> <h4>Three Cheers for Diplomacy!</h4> <p>But today, over half a century later, the United States and Russia share a giant\n   orbiting timeshare in outer space, and the only thing remotely Communist about vodka\n   is how freely Smirnoff Ice bottles get shared on college campuses. The world is\n   ready for the return of the Moscow Mule.\n</p> <p>In addition to the original Cock N' Bull ginger beer, the Moscow Mule Crate includes a pair of authentic\n   copper drinking mugs, Tovolo ice cube mold, 16 oz. mixed drink shaker, and measuring jigger, so\n   you can enjoy one of America's finest, definitely-not-Russian mixed drinks.\n</p> <p>Mix it up the classy way, and taste the kick of the Moscow Mule.</p>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>Oktober State of Mind</h4> <p>Oktoberfest, the 17-day stein-clanking, pretzel-munching pride and joy of Germany, is actually\r\n   very American when you think about it. Nothing screams \"Freedom!\" louder than gorging\r\n   one's self on another culture's delicacies while drinking liters gallons of beer in a foreign land with friends\r\n   and festive strangers.\r\n</p> <p>In true American fashion, we've decided to do Oktoberfest better than the people who invented it by making\r\n   it last longer--much longer. The Oktoberfest Man Crate is America's greatest innovation: 365 Days of\r\n   Oktoberfest.\r\n</p> <h4>Der Biermeister</h4> <p>Say what you will about Germans, their outlandish haircuts, and complete inability to comprehend sarcasm\r\n   (and believe us, we do), but those Deutschlanders sure know how to appreciate a good brew. The glass\r\n   stein is reserved for the no-nonsense beer drinker.\r\n</p> <p>Forever unite yourself with the Spirit of Oktober by etching your name into a glass Oktoberfest stein.\r\n   And for the record, just because this mammoth of a mug can hold enough beer for\r\n   two does not mean you're obligated to share. Your name is permanently engraved on\r\n   it for a reason.\r\n</p> <p>The crate also contains two Oktoberfest stein-sized coaster/bottle openers. One to rest underneath your\r\n   personalized stein, and another to get your reload primed for pouring.\r\n</p> <h4>Snacktober</h4> <p>It's not Oktober unless you're importing Germany's finest traditional foods like Bavarian salami\r\n   and summer sausage, pretzels, and Inglehoffer Stone Ground Mustard straight into your chomper chamber. And\r\n   if you're looking for \"authentisch Sauerkraut\", Saverne's Artisanal \"Craft Beer\" Kraut is as authentically\r\n   German as a jolly mountaineer prancing around in Lederhosen yodeling David Hasselhoff's \"Looking for\r\n   Freedom\".\r\n</p> <p>Keep Oktober as your state of mind all the time with the Oktoberfest Crate.</p>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>BYOB (Be Your Own Brewmaster)</h4> <p>Beer is the Rosetta Stone of humanity, the one universally consumed and celebrated\r\n   thread tying every culture and era of civilization together. The Sumerians wrote\r\n   hymns to the exhilarating nature of beer, the Chinese experimented extensively with\r\n   rice fermentations, and there's even cursory evidence of beer predating human history.\r\n   (Those monkeys were crafty!)\r\n</p> <p>In past days, the brewers were the esteemed men of the world, the gatekeepers to the ethereal knowledge of\r\n   medicine, pleasure, and the divine. Nowadays, we've degraded the ancient craft to big industry corporations\r\n   and a shoddy baseball team in Milwaukee.\r\n</p> <p>The best way to restore rightful honor to the lost art of beer brewing, to bottle your impeccable taste on\r\n   the most intricate level, is to do it yourself.\r\n</p> <h4>Get Weird With Your Beer</h4> <p>Start stocking your well-curated home bar with well-aerated home beer brewed in your very\r\n   kitchen. The Micro Brewed project kit features the floral and citrusy aroma, balanced\r\n   flavors, and American pedigree of Centennial Hops and a SMASH (Single Malt and Single\r\n   Hop) Recipe that pulls everything out of the way to let the Centennial hops speak\r\n   unimpeded.\r\n</p> <p>And these hops have a lot to say.</p> <p>The 1.5 gallon Little Bubbler gives more head room than a topless Jeep Wrangler for the most robust of\r\n   beers, yet is small enough to fit comfortably in a Brooklyn wash closet of a studio\r\n   apartment. The one gallon batch size invites more freedom and creativity into your\r\n   recipes, so you can embrace your artistic genius unimpeded, with less pride to swallow\r\n   if your secret ingredient is less hit and more miss.\r\n</p> <h4>Fermentation Activation!</h4> <p>Racking, measuring, sanitizing, and bottling: all things you will soon be intimately\r\n   familiar with. Intimately. We've curated the ultimate collection of tubes and jib-jabs\r\n   to transform simple ingredients into a beer that will make friends and colleagues\r\n   enjoy, respect, and deeply envy your brewing expertise.\r\n</p> <p>Carry on the legacy of first-rate fermentation and inject some hoppiness into your happiness with the\r\n   Home Brewed project kit.\r\n</p>",

Barbecue with the complex flavors of craft\n   beer(unknown character)IPA hops, porter brown malt(unknown character)or even a nice chianti. It's also more stable than a regular aluminium can\n   and provides great exterior browning on all sides.\n</p> <p>The Just Cook ancho chili rub and spice blend take it to the next level, proving\n   that Beer Can Chicken is far more than a party trick. We've also thrown in a Poultry\n   Button thermometer and shears, so any ale-infused fowl will be perfectly fire-roasted,\n   split and served. Malt, meet meat.\n</p>",
